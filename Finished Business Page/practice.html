      <div><p>Our approach to upskilling leverages our observation-based selection process and emphasizes hands-on, work-based 
        learning. This delivers maximum business value to our customers by reducing risk and saving thousands of dollars vs. typical 
        training methodologies.</p></div>
      <div><p>We walk the talk when it comes to putting people first, and our team has decades of experience managing entry-level Apprentice 
        and Internship programs that are proven to identify and rapidly develop developers and engineers. We design programs that incentivize
         great outcomes for Apprentices, and quickly become a critical component of our Customersâ€™ overall talent strategy.</p></div>
